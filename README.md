```html
<div class="container valigner valigner-bottom">
  <div class="col-sm-2">
    Block 1
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-10">
    Block 2
  </div>
</div>
```

##Maintenance
This module is not complete and it does not fully cover the same functionality for old browsers.
It now supports only the browsers that understand "flex", check them out https://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox.
